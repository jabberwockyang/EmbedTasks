The lack of follicular development results in **anovulatory cycles** (no corpus luteum and no progesterone production), in which the endometrium continuously proliferates under the effect of estrogen from adipose tissue. The bleeding that occurs in PCOS is not true menstrual bleeding, which is caused by progesterone withdrawal at the end of the menstrual cycle, but anovulatory bleeding, in which partial shedding of the hyperplastic endometrium occurs intermittently at irregular intervals because estrogen cannot maintain the proliferating endometrium. In patients with anovulatory cycles, the administration of progesterone would result in differentiation and maintenance of the endometrium, and subsequent withdrawal of progesterone would cause withdrawal bleeding (progestin challenge test).

"""**Digital clubbing** is a sign of **chronic hypoxemia**, which is a complication of an untreated VSD. VSDs are acyanotic congenital heart defects that manifest as a left-to-right shunt. An untreated VSD can lead to chronic volume overload of the right ventricle (RV) and subsequently increased blood flow through the pulmonary vasculature. This increased flow causes irreversible remodeling of the small pulmonary vessels, leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance and RV hypertrophy. RV pressure increases until it exceeds left ventricular (LV) pressure, at which point the shunt is reversed. This **shunt reversal** is known as **Eisenmenger syndrome**. Cyanosis and consequently, chronic tissue hypoxia, leads to the development of digital clubbing.

Because newborns have a higher hematocrit (due to relative hypoxia during the fetal period) and a shorter life span of fetal red blood cells (RBCs), RBC turnover is increased within the first 3 months of life, resulting in higher bilirubin production. In addition, the hepatic conjugation and elimination pathways for bilirubin are still immature due to decreased activity of the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. The enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin is also increased because the concentration of bacteria in the neonatal digestive tract is low and therefore only a small amount of bilirubin is converted to urobilinogen and subsequently excreted.

In this scenario, the physician immediately made a diagnosis (costochondritis) and failed to consider an alternative cause for the patient’s chest pain (myocardial infarction). The physician should have taken the patient’s risk factors for cardiovascular disease (i.e., older age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension) into account and performed further diagnostic testing. An electrocardiogram is indicated for patients > 35 years of age with suspected costochondritis. If the physician had been aware of his cognitive bias, myocardial infarction could have been diagnosed at the office, which may have improved the patient's outcome. Strategies to avoid cognitive biases include education on cognitive errors, diagnostic time-outs, differential diagnosis generators, and checklists.In many situations, several cognitive errors can occur simultaneously. Omission bias, overconfidence, and availability bias may have also occurred in this scenario.""

Because effluent from the ECF can be corrosive to skin, a **pouch** should be placed over the exit site to facilitate collection. Patients with low-output or moderate-output fistulas can be managed with enteral or oral feeding.

"""Most diseases are multifactorial inheritance disorders (MIDs). The risk of a MID has a positive correlation with the **probability** of having **disease-causing alleles** and the probability of exposure to disease-causing environmental factors. For example, individuals with the lowest risk have none of the disease-causing alleles and no exposure to disease-causing environmental factors. A MID's risk generally has a normal distribution and individuals who have a risk above a certain liability threshold will develop the disease. The probability of having disease-causing alleles is in turn positively correlated with the **number of relatives with the disease** and the **disease severity** in affected relatives. For these reasons, MIDs often cluster in families or certain population groups. The risk for the next offspring given that one child is already affected (a conditional probability) is higher than the prevalence of the disease in the general population.

In this case, as the physician determined that the patient received ten times the prescribed dose, the transcribing error was most likely due to the misinterpretation of a trailing zero after a decimal point. Trailing zeros are part of the Joint Commission's “Do Not Use” list, which provides recommendations on information management. To **prevent transcribing errors**, most hospitals have adopted **computerized provider order entry (CPOE) systems**, which also have the advantage of helping to **prevent ordering errors** because they are usually combined with a **clinical decision support system**.

"""Rhythm control with cardioversion is a treatment approach used for some patients with new-onset Afib (e.g., young and/or pregnant patients) and aims to restore sinus rhythm in order to prevent atrial remodeling and improve symptoms. However, prolonged episodes of Afib significantly increase the risk of atrial thrombi formation and subsequent dislodgement during cardioversion. Therefore, hemodynamically stable patients who have had **Afib for ≥ 48 hours or an unknown period of time** require systemic **anticoagulation** **for 3 weeks prior to cardioversion**. If cardioversion is desired earlier (e.g., in pregnant and/or symptomatic patients), the **time to cardioversion can be shortened** by performing **transesophageal echocardiography** (TEE) to detect potential thrombi and guide further management.TEE is not required prior to cardioversion in hemodynamically unstable patients with Afib, as the risk of complications from hemodynamic instability outweighs the risk of thromboembolic complications after cardioversion.The management of hemodynamically stable, symptomatic patients with Afib with rapid ventricular response usually also includes rate control (e.g., with a beta blocker) as one of the first steps in management.

In gestations < 9 weeks, if the EDD derived from CRL differs from that calculated by the last menstrual period by more than 5 days, the EDD should be changed to correspond to the value obtained by CRL measurement. This step is important because a wrong gestational age/EDD can influence pregnancy outcomes at the end of gestation (e.g., increased incidence of induction of labor by misclassifying the pregnancy as post term).After 14 weeks of gestation (CRL > 84 mm), the accuracy of CRL in predicting gestational age decreases because of progressive curvature in the longitudinal axis of the fetus. At this stage, other measures such as biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference, and femoral length are used to estimate the gestational age if dating was not done during the first trimester. The accuracy of these measures at estimating the gestational age is, however, lower (error of ± 1–2 weeks) when compared to CRL. Beyond 20 weeks, however, the margin of error is large with all biometric parameters (± 3 weeks).""

"""In COPD, chronic bronchopulmonary inflammation results in increased amounts of local neutrophils and macrophages, both of which release elastases and free radicals that destroy the bronchoalveolar elastic fibers and supporting tissue, ultimately destroying alveolar walls. The destruction of the elastic fibers causes a decrease in lung elasticity and an increase in lung compliance. The loss of elastic supporting tissue around the distal terminal bronchioli and respiratory units leads to premature closure of the small airways during expiration, which causes air trapping distal to the collapsed bronchioli and, subsequently, emphysema. Chronic hyperinflation (indicated by the increased TLC) due to loss of collapsing pressure of the lungs results in **diaphragmatic flattening**, which **impairs this muscle's normal function**: expansion of the thoracic cavity and subsequent airflow into the lungs during inspiration.

Patients with SCI become unaware of bladder filling and **feel no urge to void**, resulting in an overfilled and overdistended bladder that is palpable in the suprapubic region. When intravesical pressure rises above bladder outlet resistance, involuntary dribbling of urine occurs. SCI at or below the sacral micturition center can also cause overflow incontinence due to damage to the lower motor neurons that form part of the micturition reflex arc. Urinary retention in patients with an atonic bladder is best managed by clean **intermittent catheterization**.Another cause of overflow incontinence is bladder outflow obstruction (e.g., benign prostatic hyperplasia in men or pelvic organ prolapse and uterine fibroids in women).

"""The characteristic finding associated with persistent vomiting or excessive nasogastric (NG) suctioning is **hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis**. Hypokalemia in contraction alkalosis is caused by several mechanisms. The primary driver is hypovolemia\-induced RAAS activation and aldosterone release, which promotes renal K<sup>+ </sup> and H<sup>+ </sup> excretion and thereby further contributes to both hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Furthermore, in alkalemia, extracellular K<sup>+</sup> is driven into the cell in exchange for intracellular H<sup>+</sup> (via Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>\-ATPase) to compensate for high blood pH levels. Persistent vomiting or excessive NG suctioning also causes loss of K<sup>+</sup> in excess of free water loss; gastric secretions have a higher concentration of K<sup>+</sup> (approx. 10–15 mEq/L) when compared to plasma due to K<sup>+</sup> leakage via KCNE2/KCNQ1 channels on the lumen of parietal cells.Treatment of contraction alkalosis (a chloride-responsive metabolic alkalosis) consists of fluid therapy with 0.9% NaCl to correct the extracellular volume loss and replete chloride, thereby ensuring adequate Cl<sup>-</sup> delivery to the distal convoluted tubule (DCT). Adequate Cl<sup>-</sup> delivery to the DCT is necessary for the activity of the pendrin exchanger, which reabsorbs Cl<sup>-</sup> in exchange for excreting HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> into the lumen of the DCT.
